## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of nums and an integer x, write a program to find the **upper bound** of **x** .

The **upper bound** of **x** is defined as the **smallest index** i such that **nums[i] > x** .

If no such index is found, return the size of the array.

### Example 1:

**Input:** n= 4, nums = [1,2,2,3], x = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] > x.

### Example 2:

**Input:** n = 5, nums = [3,5,8,15,19], x = 9

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] > x.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- &nbsp;&nbsp;1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- &nbsp;&nbsp;-10^5 < nums[i], x < 10^5
- &nbsp;&nbsp;nums is sorted in ascending order.

## 💡 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
- **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$
